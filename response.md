After reviewing the code, I've identified the issue in the aggregation process. The problem lies in the `AggregationManager` class in the `aggregation.py` file. The current implementation is not correctly aggregating the data from individual URL insights. Let's update the `aggregate_insights` method to properly aggregate the data.

File Path: C:\Users\jroak\OneDrive\Desktop\Projects\SEODP\src\seodp\lib\manager\aggregation.py

Changes:
- Updated the `aggregate_insights` method to correctly aggregate data from individual URL insights.
- Added logic to handle traffic, ranking, and page speed changes.
- Improved the aggregation of critical issues and opportunities.
- Added a method to identify important URL insights.

Updated Code:

        if "traffic_change" in url_insights:
            traffic_change = url_insights["traffic_change"]
            if traffic_change["direction"] in ["increased", "decreased"] and abs(traffic_change["percentage"]) > 20:

        return False
```

These changes should correctly aggregate the data from individual URL insights, including traffic changes, ranking changes, page speed changes, critical issues, and opportunities. The `_is_important_insight` method has been added to identify URLs with significant changes, which are then included in the `important_url_insights` section of the aggregated insights.
