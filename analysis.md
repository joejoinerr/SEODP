## Analysis of Current vs. Prior Data

Here's a breakdown of the changes between the current and prior data sets, focusing on significant differences:

**Google Analytics:**

* **Bounce Rate:** Increased from 0.42 to 0.47 (a 11.9% increase). This indicates a higher percentage of users are leaving the page after viewing only one page. 
* **Average Time on Page:** Decreased from 175.73s to 149.81s (a 14.7% decrease). This, coupled with the higher bounce rate, suggests users might be finding the content less engaging.
* **Engagement Rate:** Decreased from 0.58 to 0.53 (an 8.6% decrease), confirming a drop in user engagement.
* **Referring Sites:** The diversity of referring sites decreased in the current data, with fewer Google domains referring traffic. 

**Search Console:**

* **Clicks:** Decreased from 35 to 40 (a 14.2% decrease).
* **Impressions:** Decreased from 3631 to 3219 (an 11.3% decrease).
* **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** Increased from 0.96% to 1.24% (a 29% increase) despite the drop in clicks. This implies a potential improvement in ranking for keywords that are driving clicks.
* **Average Position:** Improved from 73.19 to 67.88 (a 7.2% decrease), supporting the possibility of better ranking.
* **Ranking Keywords:** The data sets showcase different keyword sets. Some keywords present in the prior data are missing in the current one, suggesting potential fluctuations in keyword rankings.

**Page Speed Insights:**

* **Desktop Performance:**  The performance score slightly decreased from 0.67 to 0.62. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and Total Blocking Time (TBT) increased, indicating slower loading times.
* **Mobile Performance:** The performance score significantly decreased from 0.33 to 0.23. LCP, TBT, and Time to Interactive (TTI) all increased significantly, indicating much slower loading times on mobile.

**Overall Insights:**

* **User Engagement:** The most concerning trend is the decreased user engagement, evident in the higher bounce rate, lower average time on page, and lower engagement rate. This might be related to slower page speed, particularly on mobile.
* **Search Visibility:** There are signs of improvement in search visibility, with a better average position and a higher CTR. However, this is coupled with a decrease in both clicks and impressions, suggesting the need for further analysis into keyword performance.
* **Page Speed:** The decrease in page speed, particularly on mobile, needs immediate attention. It is likely contributing to the lower engagement metrics and could be harming search ranking. 

**Recommendations:**

* Investigate the reasons behind the increase in bounce rate. Analyze user behavior on the page, possibly using heatmaps or session recordings, to identify any issues.
* Optimize page speed, especially for mobile users. Focus on reducing LCP, TBT, and TTI by optimizing image sizes, leveraging browser caching, and minimizing render-blocking resources.
* Further analyze keyword performance. Identify the keywords driving traffic in both data sets and understand the reasons behind any ranking fluctuations. Consider expanding keyword targeting to regain lost impressions.
